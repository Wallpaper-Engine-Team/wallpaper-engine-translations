# Wallpaper Engine Translations

This repository hosts the translation files for Wallpaper Engine ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960 ) to make collaboration easier.

New strings will be added to locale/core_en-us.json and locale/ui_en-us.json. They then need to be translated into the other available languages, you should submit those as pull requests.

For more information you can check out the translation thread on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431960/discussions/7/215439774876424597/

We use Travis to run validation scripts to ensure the submitted translations are valid JSON files and that special elements like variables and line breaks are not missing from the specific translation strings. If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask in the Steam Community discussions or create an issue on Github.
