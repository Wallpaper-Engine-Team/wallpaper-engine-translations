Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XX－Windowsファイアウォール検知とAndroid版修正

Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XXアップデートではアンドロイド版のリリースに関連して最も頻繁に生じている問題を対処し、Windows版とAndroid版のアプリをどちらも更新します。

今回のアップデートではアンドロイド版のリリースに関連して最も頻繁に生じている問題を対処し、Windows版とAndroid版のアプリをどちらも更新します。

[h2]Android版とWindows版のアプリの接続[/h2]
最も頻繁に報告を受けた問題は、追加の壁紙をダウンロードするためにAndroid版とWindows版のアプリを接続することに関する問題でした。 この問題を調査した結果、多くの場合でその原因となっていたのはWindowsファイアウォールでした。 過去にWallpaper Engine（"ui32.exe"）からネットワークへのアクセス許可を求められた際に、単にそのウィンドウを閉じてしまっていたり、Wallpaper Engineに許可を与えていなかった場合、Wallpaper Engineのプロセスがローカルネットワークに正しく接続するのをWindowsが自動的にブロックしてしまうでしょう。

[i]もしこの時に「キャンセル（Cancel）」をクリックしていたり、ウィンドウを閉じてしまっていた場合、WindowsファイアウォールによってWallpaper Engineがブロックされてしまいます。[/i]

以上のような問題を検知しようとする新しい検査手段を追加しました。これにより、Windowsファイアウォールを自動で修正することが可能になるでしょう。 However, if you do not get any notification about the Windows firewall or if you use any other firewall application, then Wallpaper Engine cannot fix your local network automatically.

If you have any additional firewall or antivirus applications installed, you need to ensure that [b]ui32.exe[/b] is not being blocked.

Wallpaper Engine on Windows will now also use additional methods to broadcast itself on your network which will also make it more accessible to Android devices under certain network configurations.

If your connection issues persist, please read the following help page:

When placing wallpaper files on your mobile device, always make sure to use the [b]Downloads[/b] directory on your phone or tablet. Android is very restrictive for security reasons and Wallpaper Engine cannot access every Android folder, but the Downloads directory is usually the most reliable.

[h2]Lock-screen Wallpapers on Android[/h2]
Since it is a very common request that we received via email and on our forums, we just wanted to re-iterate this here: [b]Wallpaper Engine fully supports live wallpapers on the Android lock-screen.[/b] However, a lot of phones and tablets do not support live wallpapers on the lock-screen.

If you are not given the option to set a live wallpaper on your lock-screen, then this is a limitation set by your phone manufacturer. Wallpaper Engine has no control over this and this cannot be fixed by us or any other live wallpaper app. The best thing you can do in such a case is to send feedback to your phone manufacturer and let them know that this is a feature you care about, it's something that could be added in an Android update.

[h2]Android App Update[/h2]
The latest Android app may take a few days until it reaches everyone, as mobile stores tend to roll out updates more slowly. If you have installed the Android APK directly, make sure to download the latest version from our website:
