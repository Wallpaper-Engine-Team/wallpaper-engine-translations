Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XX - Windows 防火墙检测和 Android 修复

Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XX 更新可解决与 Android 发布版本有关的最常见问题，我们将更新该应用程序的 Windows 和 Android 版本。

今天的更新可解决与 Android 发布版本有关的最常见问题，我们将更新应用程序的 Windows 和 Android 版本。

[h2]连接 Android 和 Windows 应用程序[/h2]
我们收到的最常见问题涉及到连接 Android 应用程序与 Windows 应用程序以下载更多壁纸。 我们已经调查过该问题，在许多情况下，该问题由 Windows 防火墙导致。 如果 Windows 之前曾经要求您授予 Wallpaper Engine ("ui32.exe") 访问您网络的权限，而您只是关闭了窗口或没有授予 Wallpaper Engine 该权限，则 Windows 将自动阻止 Wallpaper Engine 的进程与您的本地网络正常通信：

[i]如果您在此处单击了“取消”或只是关闭了窗口，则 Wallpaper Engine 将被阻止在您的 Windows 防火墙中。[/i]

我们现在添加了一项新检查，该检查将尝试检测此类问题，并为您提供自动修复 Windows 防火墙的方法。 However, if you do not get any notification about the Windows firewall or if you use any other firewall application, then Wallpaper Engine cannot fix your local network automatically.

If you have any additional firewall or antivirus applications installed, you need to ensure that [b]ui32.exe[/b] is not being blocked.

Wallpaper Engine on Windows will now also use additional methods to broadcast itself on your network which will also make it more accessible to Android devices under certain network configurations.

If your connection issues persist, please read the following help page:

When placing wallpaper files on your mobile device, always make sure to use the [b]Downloads[/b] directory on your phone or tablet. Android is very restrictive for security reasons and Wallpaper Engine cannot access every Android folder, but the Downloads directory is usually the most reliable.

[h2]Lock-screen Wallpapers on Android[/h2]
Since it is a very common request that we received via email and on our forums, we just wanted to re-iterate this here: [b]Wallpaper Engine fully supports live wallpapers on the Android lock-screen.[/b] However, a lot of phones and tablets do not support live wallpapers on the lock-screen.

If you are not given the option to set a live wallpaper on your lock-screen, then this is a limitation set by your phone manufacturer. Wallpaper Engine has no control over this and this cannot be fixed by us or any other live wallpaper app. The best thing you can do in such a case is to send feedback to your phone manufacturer and let them know that this is a feature you care about, it's something that could be added in an Android update.

[h2]Android App Update[/h2]
The latest Android app may take a few days until it reaches everyone, as mobile stores tend to roll out updates more slowly. If you have installed the Android APK directly, make sure to download the latest version from our website:
