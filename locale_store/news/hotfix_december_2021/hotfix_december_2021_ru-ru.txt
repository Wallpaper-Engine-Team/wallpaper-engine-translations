[list][*] [url=https://help.wallpaperengine.io/mobile/pairing-fixes.html]Android App Connection Troubleshooting[/url][/list] Keep in mind that you can always use the export functionality as a backup and simply transfer your wallpapers to your mobile device via USB or another method. When placing wallpaper files on your mobile device, always make sure to use the [b]Downloads[/b] directory on your phone or tablet. Android is very restrictive for security reasons and Wallpaper Engine cannot access every Android folder, but the Downloads directory is usually the most reliable.

[h2]Lock-screen Wallpapers on Android[/h2]
Since it is a very common request that we received via email and on our forums, we just wanted to re-iterate this here: [b]Wallpaper Engine fully supports live wallpapers on the Android lock-screen.[/b] However, a lot of phones and tablets do not support live wallpapers on the lock-screen.

If you are not given the option to set a live wallpaper on your lock-screen, then this is a limitation set by your phone manufacturer. Wallpaper Engine has no control over this and this cannot be fixed by us or any other live wallpaper app. The best thing you can do in such a case is to send feedback to your phone manufacturer and let them know that this is a feature you care about, it's something that could be added in an Android update.

[h2]Android App Update[/h2]
The latest Android app may take a few days until it reaches everyone, as mobile stores tend to roll out updates more slowly. If you have installed the Android APK directly, make sure to download the latest version from our website:

[list][*][h3][url=https://www.wallpaperengine.io/android]Wallpaper Engine for Android [/url][/h3][/list] If you have installed the app through an official app store, there is nothing you need to do and the update will be installed on your device automatically within the next few days.
