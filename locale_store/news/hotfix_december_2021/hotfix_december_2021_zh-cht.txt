Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XX：Windows 防火牆偵測與 Android 修復

Wallpaper Engine 2.0.XX 更新版本可解決與 Android 發布版本最常見的問題，我們也正在更新該應用程式的 Windows 及 Android 版本。

今天發布的更新版本可解決與 Android 發布版本最常見的問題，我們也正在更新該應用程式的 Windows 及 Android 版本。

[h2]連接 Android 及 Windows 版應用程式[/h2]
我們最常收到的問題是，欲下載更多桌布時，無法連接 Android 版及 Windows 版應用程式。 經調查，發現許多情況都是由 Windows 防火牆造成。 如果先前 Windows 請您授予 Wallpaper Engine (「ui32.exe」) 存取網路的權限，但您直接關閉視窗或當初並未開啟 Wallpaper Engine 權限，Windows 將自動阻擋 Wallpaper Engine 與您的區域網路正常通訊：

[i]如果您按下「取消」或是直接關閉視窗，Wallpaper Engine 則會遭到 Windows 防火牆封鎖。[/i]

我們新增了一項檢查功能，會協助偵測此類問題，並提供自動修復 Windows 防火牆的方式。 不過如果您並未收到 Windows 防火牆任何通知，或如果您有其他防火牆應用程式，Wallpaper Engine 就無法自動修復您的區域網路。

如果您安裝了任何其他防火牆或防毒應用程式，必須確定 [b]ui32.exe[/b] 並未遭到封鎖。

Windows 上的 Wallpaper Engine 現在也會使用其他方法在您的網路上廣播，將有助在某些網路設定下的 Android 裝置更方便存取此應用程式。

如果仍有連接問題，請閱讀以下說明頁面：

[h2]Lock-screen Wallpapers on Android[/h2]
Since it is a very common request that we received via email and on our forums, we just wanted to re-iterate this here: [b]Wallpaper Engine fully supports live wallpapers on the Android lock-screen.[/b] However, a lot of phones and tablets do not support live wallpapers on the lock-screen.

If you are not given the option to set a live wallpaper on your lock-screen, then this is a limitation set by your phone manufacturer. Wallpaper Engine has no control over this and this cannot be fixed by us or any other live wallpaper app. The best thing you can do in such a case is to send feedback to your phone manufacturer and let them know that this is a feature you care about, it's something that could be added in an Android update.

[h2]Android App Update[/h2]
The latest Android app may take a few days until it reaches everyone, as mobile stores tend to roll out updates more slowly. If you have installed the Android APK directly, make sure to download the latest version from our website:

[list][*][h3][url=https://www.wallpaperengine.io/android]Wallpaper Engine for Android [/url][/h3][/list] If you have installed the app through an official app store, there is nothing you need to do and the update will be installed on your device automatically within the next few days.
