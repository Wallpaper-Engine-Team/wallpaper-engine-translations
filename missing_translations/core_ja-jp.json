This can happen due to download errors in [[[Platform]]] or anti-virus programs falsely detecting files and causing problems. If you have an anti-virus besides Windows Defender, make sure that it does not interfere with [[[Platform]]] and Wallpaper Engine.\n\nMake sure the application is closed while updating (close through tray icon or Task Manager if necessary) and no anti-virus is preventing your computer from working correctly.\n\nIf your anti-virus deleted files of Wallpaper Engine, you need to restore them and whitelist the path of Wallpaper Engine so the anti-virus stops deleting random files."
